    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Stream temperature is a key driver of performance in aquatic species and directly reflects a changing climate. Siegel et al. (2023) developed a statistical stream temperature model and produced predictions for over 260,000 free-flowing stream reaches throughout the Pacific Northwest (PNW; Washington, Oregon, and Idaho) every day from 1990 through 2021. The model combined and enhanced elements of existing stream temperature models to reflect mechanistic processes using publicly available climate and landscape covariates in a Generalized Additive Model framework. The model was fit to empirical stream temperatures from the NorWeST database (1993–2013) and covariates interacted to allow nonlinear relationships between temporal and spatial covariates to capture seasonal patterns. The model used a moving average of antecedent air temperatures linked to streamflow; the moving average window size was longer for reaches with snow-dominated hydrology, especially at higher flows, whereas window size was relatively constant and low for reaches with rain-dominated hydrology. The daily model fit well (RMSE=1.76; MAE=1.32°C) and cross-validation suggested that the model produced useful predictions at unsampled locations across diverse landscapes and environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied the Siegel et al. (2023) model, using covariates of future air temperature from an ensemble of 10 Global Circulation Models, and snowpack and streamflow from a hydrological model, to predict future stream temperatures across streams in the PNW at a coarser spatial resolution (i.e., fewer smaller streams) every day from 1950 through 2099. These predictions can be used to model potential freshwater thermal habitats for Pacific salmon and other species, and can inform conservation and restoration decisions.  These future datasets are found in \"Stream Temperature Projections\" projects."

    "## Caveats\n",
    "The stream temperature predictions should be used with appropriate caution. Although predictions are made at high spatial and temporal resolution, they are only as good as the spatiotemporal resolution of the covariates, which varied and may have been coarser. As well, the model was not designed to capture or reflect effects of dams and thus any predictions near dams or reservoirs should be used cautiously. Any temperatures above 35°C should be regarded as suspicious; these could have been produced at boundaries where covariate values were artificially truncated, or in cases where GAM curves predicted anomalous outcomes."
